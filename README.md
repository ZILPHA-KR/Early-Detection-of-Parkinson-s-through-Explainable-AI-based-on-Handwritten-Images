# Early-Detection-of-Parkinson-s-through-Explainable-AI-based-on-Handwritten-Images
This project focuses on improving early Parkinson's detection using Explainable AI techniques applied to handwriting analysis. It aims to develop a hybrid CNN model, classify samples, and utilize Grad-CAM for interpretability, improving diagnostic accuracy and trust in AI for better patient outcomes.
